# Somatic-ShortV

The scripts in this repository call somatic short variants (SNPs and indels) following [GATK's Best Practices Workflow](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035894731-Somatic-short-variant-discovery-SNVs-Indels-). The workflow and scripts have been specifically optimised to run efficiently and at scale on the __National Compute Infrastructure, Gadi.__
